Several language schools offer a wide variety of courses. Plenty of online material 
exist to get started. It is even possible to start before you arrive in Copenhagen.

## Online Material

### Duolingo (free)
Duolingo offers a broad range of topics and example sentences. If you use their website,
instead of their app, you can do as many exercises as you want for free **and** have 
additional explanations on the grammar. Furthermore the website-version of duolingo offers
free typing - which will force you to remember Danish a lot more than only assembling single
words to phrases. 

### Babbel
Berlin based Babbel has - end of 2020 - a paid basic language offer for Danish. Some people
prefer their course over getting started in Duolingo. 

### Youtube
