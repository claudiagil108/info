## Apartment - life without basecamp

To get an apartement you need to have a CPR number and to get this you need to register at an address. 

To register at an address you need to live somewhere for 30 days or more and have permission from the flat or house owner to register at their address.

There is a housing registration document available from international house that needs to be filled out and signed by both you and the landlord and you also have to provide a receipt for the rent.
  

One way of making this work is to rent an Air BnB for a month where you have agreed prior to renting it that the owner will sign your housing registration document. 
Then you have a whole month to have a look for an apartment.

Bolig portalen is a good site for this, it is in danish, but google translate seems to work well. There are also other sites, but quite often you have to pay to message landlords so keep an eye out for this.

It is also possible to ask the administration in your centre to send an email to employees to see if anyone knows of a spare room.
