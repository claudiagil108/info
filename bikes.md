# Bikes

You need a bike in Copenhagen. There is just no way around it.

## Rental Bikes

Buying one here, even from a second hand store, might be a bit pricy, especially if you haven't been paid yet. Luckily there are retal options available to get started.

### Swapfiets

[Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.dk/en/offer/copenhagen) offers decent, affordable rental bikes that you can use until you've been paid and bought your own. You rent them on a monthly basis with the minimun rental period being 2 months. While they are designed for the city, their bikes are also light enough to be used by DTU commuters. The regular price per month is DKK 175.00 with a discount price of DKK 150.00 for anyone who still has a valid student card. Keep in mind that the bike should be booked at least two weeks in advance as they are in high demand! So maybe take care of that before arriving here, you can book a date to pick it up or let them deliver it to you. Once you've realised it you will see their distincetive blue front wheels all over town.

> Personal comment: if you do use them to go to the DTU, bring a shirt to change.
